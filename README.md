# PHP Clean Architecture

### Overview
Implementing Clean Architecture design, allows the software business logic to be built independentely from it's delivery/exposure, as well as, reducing its own dependencies. By breaking down into several layers, and establishing a comunication flow between them, the application is better set for success when talking about scalability, testability, and maintenance. Clean Architecture was created in 2012 by Robert C. Martin, and this repository suggests one approach using PHP code and tools.

*The Goal* 
Create an application boilerplate allowing an opinionated approach of a `Clean Architecture` using PHP.

*Why?*
When working with C# and .Net, right from the start we're used to segregating the application into multiple layers. The DAL (Data Access Layer) and the BAL (Business Access Layer) are examples of that. The application structure starts to be designed right on the moment an empty `solution` is created followed by the creation of each project with its own defined scope. Each project has also an important configuration step, by defining which compiled outcome is expected to be produced, `.Net Standard 2.*` vs `.Net Core`, so the engineering team can define how generic those `DLL` are meant to be (and how portable between .Net versions they are meant to be).
One great example of a `Clean Architecture` with `.Net Core` belongs to [Json Taylor](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture). In the linked `Github` repository we can find a `.Net Core 6` solution template. The code is organised into several layers, in the chape of `.Net Core` projects, in which the right dependencies flow is established.

What about PHP? 
One key fact: `We are used to create a project using a well known framework, and organise the code inside of it`. Because we rely purely on the framework lifecycle we may end up with:
- a huge codebase with many duplicated code and dependencies.
- many violations of code principles.
- increased `tech debt` if the focus is only on growing the number of features inside the codebase
- difficulty upgrading external dependencies (packages or framework version), given the business logic is spread in the same main parent folder
- testing becomes dependent of the used framework (and eventually is neglected).

What if we could reduce the dependencies between components on a PHP project? Although the latest PHP Frameworks offer great flexibility, modularisation, and version upgrade support, what if we protect the application's business logic in a way that everything external we need to import is detached from our core logic, consumes our core logic, and is hidden from our core logic?
Let's try to create an approach to Clean Architecture, using PHP.

### Comply with the basic principles
As explained at `Uncle Bob` blog post:

1. Independent of Frameworks. The architecture does not depend on the existence of some library of feature laden software. This allows you to use such frameworks as tools, rather than having to cram your system into their limited constraints.
2. Testable. The business rules can be tested without the UI, Database, Web Server, or any other external element.
3. Independent of UI. The UI can change easily, without changing the rest of the system. A Web UI could be replaced with a console UI, for example, without changing the business rules.
4. Independent of Database. You can swap out Oracle or SQL Server, for Mongo, BigTable, CouchDB, or something else. Your business rules are not bound to the database.
5. Independent of any external agency. In fact your business rules simply donâ€™t know anything at all about the outside world.

### The layers

#### Domain
An abstract layer containing the core objects for the business logic to process. Are part of this layer `entities`, `constants`, `enums`, `exceptions`, etc...

#### Application
This layer will contain the business logic code to process my application's logic.
It's framework independent, and only knows my Domain layer

#### Web
This is the main point of contact for the client's requests.
Here one or multiple interfaces will provide the request and response interface 

The framework should be used as a tool, instead of the main driver. 
This is an important topic when designing an application implementing Clean Architecture using PHP. As the current state of the art regarding PHP is that frameworks (such as Symfony, Laravel, etc...) are adapting (very well) to become fully flexible to the application type an engineering team needs, the dev community is increasingly relying on this "all-in-one" project solutions. As an outcome, the engineering team is trying to fit the busines logic inside the framework lifecycle.
From Http request/response hadling, to model-in-database design, and even the whole testing suite are examples on how well the current frameworks allow us to deliver great software, but what if the subject under development is not a micro service but a medium size API?
#### External

#### Storage


## Getting started with this repo

Use this instructions to get the project up and running.

### Required Software

*When running on Docker*:
- Docker and Docker Compose

### Using Docker

1. run `cp platform/.env-example platform/.env` 
2. run `docker compose -f platform/docker/compose.yaml up`
3. to stop and remove the containers `docker compose -f platform/docker/compose.yaml down`

#### Tips for Docker usage
- PHP extensions management inside the `php` container: `docker-php-ext-install`,  `docker-php-ext-enable`, and  `docker-php-ext-configure`
- Run `composer install` from the host `docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" composer/composer install --working-dir=<TARGET DIR TO RUN INSTALLER>`

## Backlog
- [ ] Implement Domain and Application Layer + documentation
- [ ] Implement Domain and Application Layer Tests :: as part of the same folder in `src` or under tests? >> Document it
    - [ ] When under `tests` which version should be defined: `dev-main` vs `x.y.z`
- [ ] Implement Web / Presentation Layer + documentation
- [ ] Implement Persistance layer + documentation
- [ ] Add Test coverage reports
- [ ] Document Platform folder >> Why including it
- [ ] Add k8s
